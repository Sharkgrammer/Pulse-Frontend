# Pulse (Frontend)

A social media site built in Vue.js with a Django backend. This is the Vue.js frontend component

I post about the development process on LinkedIn if you're interested in how it was designed. 

The demo branch contains the code used in the demo hosted version. It limits the user to being able to login to two accounts and removes the ability to post/comment and edit profile data.
